    "Rolling means (or moving averages) are generally used to smooth out short-term fluctuations in time series data and highlight long-term trends. You can read more about them here.\n",

    "To use the .rolling() method, you must always use method chaining, first calling .rolling() and then chaining an aggregation method after it. For example, with a Series hourly_data, hourly_data.rolling(window=24).mean() would compute new values for each hourly point, based on a 24-hour window stretching out behind each point. The frequency of the output data is the same: it is still hourly. Such an operation is useful for smoothing time series data."
